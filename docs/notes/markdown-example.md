# Markdown example

This static site generator also supports Markdown, using [pulldown-cmark](https://github.com/pulldown-cmark/pulldown-cmark)!

This provides an example of using markdown alongside djot documents in the same static site! See: [../index.dj](../index.dj) for the home page, and [../command_reference](../command_reference) for the command reference!
