# Djot Static Site Generator

This is the simplest implementation of a Djot static site generator that I could come up with. No themes, or anything.

## Usage

```shell
cargo install djot-ssg

djot-ssg <TARGET_DIRECTORY> -o [OUTPUT_DIRECTORY]
```

## Support Goals

This static site generator aims to support:

- [x] Plaintext HTML
- [x] Linking to pages within static site
- [x] Image resources

This project is not going to support these things:

- [ ] Themes (Could be reconsidered)
